# Introduction to Algorithms (Beginner Level)

**Algorithm** is basically procedures for solving problems. **Programming** is also the step by step solution of solving problems.

Software Engineering has two phases;

- **Design**
- **Implementation**

to understand algorithm and the phases of software engineering, we need to first understand the difference between algorithm and programming

|             **Algorithm**              |           **Program**            |

| Don't need Hardware/software specifics | need Hardware/software specifics |
|                Analyze                 |             Testing              |
