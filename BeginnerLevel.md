# Introduction to Algorithms

**Algorithm** is basically the step by step of solving problems. **Programming** is also the step by step solution of solving problems.

Software Engineering has two phases;

- Design
- Implementation

to understand algorithm and the phases of software engineering, we need to first understand the difference between algorithm and programming

| Algorithm                              |             Program              |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------: |
| Design                                 |          Implementation          |
| Algorithm Knowledge                    |            programmer            |
| any Language ie; maths, english        |       Programming Language       |
| Don't need Hardware/software specifics | need Hardware/software specifics |
| Analyze                                |             Testing              |
