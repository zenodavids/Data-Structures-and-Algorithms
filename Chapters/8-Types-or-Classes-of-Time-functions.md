# Types or Classes of Time Functions

## O(1) - Constant :

This type of Time function is used when the output is certain.

> f(n) = 2\
> f(n) = 5\
> f(n) = 5000\
> From the above, it doesn't matter the output, as long as the input doesn't affect the output

## O(logn) - Logarithmic :

This type of Time Function is used when the condition is based on the input and incremented or decremented by either Multiplication or division.

## O(n) - Linear :

Here, the Time Function is based on the input and is common among for loops.

Others are;

### O(n<sup>2</sup>) - Quadratic

### O(n<sup>3</sup>) - Cubic

### O(2<sup>n</sup>) - Exponential

### O(3<sup>n</sup>)

### O(n<sup>n</sup>)
