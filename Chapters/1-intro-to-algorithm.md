# Introduction to Algorithms (Beginner Level)

**Algorithm** is basically procedures for solving problems. **Programming** is also the step by step solution of solving problems.

Software Engineering has two phases;

- **Design**
- **Implementation**

to understand algorithm and the phases of software engineering, we need to first understand the difference between algorithm and programming

|    any Language ie; maths, english     |       Programming Language       |
| Don't need Hardware/software specifics | need Hardware/software specifics |
|                Analyze                 |             Testing              |

## Priori Analysis and Posteriori Testing

- **Priori Analysis:**
  Breaking the algorithm into further details and finding the time and space consumed by an algorithm

- **Posteriori Testing:**
  Testing the algorithm to see if it works as expected and finding out how many time and bytes an algorithm can take.
