## How to write an algorithm

Below is A simple Algorithm to swap two numbers;

```js
algorithm swap( a, b )
// begin algorithm
    begin

// initialize temp to a
    temp := a ;
    // swap a and b
    a := b;

    b := temp;

// end algorithm
    end

```

- Don't bother about what programming language or datatypes, that can be decided during implementation, not design.

- you can use any syntax. there is no fixed syntax for writing an algorithm

- algorithm writing should be understood by anyone
